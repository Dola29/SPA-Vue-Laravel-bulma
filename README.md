# SPA-Vue-Laravel-bulma
This is a SPA(Single Page Application) Made with VueJs, PHP, Laravel and Bulma CSS, also for the DB I used SQLITE. This is an App of practice but with really good concepts.
This was one of the first steps for me to migrate from codeigniter to laravel and my goal with this was to test differents technologies than: Codeigniter, JQuery, Mysql, BootStrap.
